        <h3>INTRODUCTION:</h3>
        <h4>Flipkart was founded in October 2007 in Bangalore by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, alumni of the IIT, Delhi and former Amazon employees. The company was started from a two-bedroom apartment in Kormangala, Bengaluru. The initial investment was provided by their families, which was INR 2 Lakh from each family. The website was kicked off in October 2007 and the company was only limited to selling books at that time country-wide shipping.Flipkart slowly grew in prominence and was receiving 100 orders per day by 2008.<br><br>
            Flipkart Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bangalore, and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially focused on online book sales before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.<br><br>
            The service competes primarily with Amazon India and domestic rival Snapdeal.As of FY23, Flipkart held a 48% market share in the Indian e-commerce industry.
            
            <h3>AT 2023:GROWTH AND MERGES:-</h3>
        <h4>The e-commerce also started a virtual storefront that is dedicated to the academic needs of students named 'Flipkart Student's Club'.<br><br>
        The 'Flipkart Green' venture was created in 2023 for customers who want to have a sustainable lifestyle by providing certified sustainable products.<br><br>

        Binny Bansal resigned from the executive team on 28 January 2024, and over the past few months, he has completely divested his stake. In the last year, Binny, along with Excel and Tiger Global Management, sold their entire stake to Walmart, resulting in Binny earning around 1.5 billion dollars. Walmart had acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart for 16 billion dollars in May 2018.<br><br>
                
        In March 2024, Flipkart launched its UPI services, Flipkart UPI, in partnership with Axis Bank. In May 2024, it was reported that Google would invest US$350 million in the company.<br><br>
                
        In the space of Generative AI, Flipkart launched Flippi - an AI powered shopping assistant available in English that helps buyers make a shopping decision. Flipkart also launched Vibes - which integrates video content and online shopping - bringing a 'window-shopping' experience for the users. Both Flippi and Vibes are part of the enhanced 'Swipe Screen' experience initiative.<br><br>
                
        Gen Z accounts for more than 25 percent of Flipkart Fashion's customer base. Hence, in August 2023, Flipkart introduced an in-app fashion platform named Spoyl, targeted at Gen Z individuals. Spoyl features a unique unisex product navigation system that allows for gender-neutral browsing of styles.
